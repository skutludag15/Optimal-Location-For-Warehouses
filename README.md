In this solution we made use of combinations and this way we were able to give the correct output regardless of the question lenght and time. The time complexity of this method is O(n*kcomb(n,k)) but it always give the correct resuılt meaning that it brute forces by trying all the combinations. The space complexity is in the order of comb(n,k). We also implemented the capability to read from files and time computation related functions.

How you run this part is by opening shell and execute the following command.

Greedy Algorithm:
For this case, the algorithm decides if there should be selected k warehouses, it selects the best one first then select the second one according with the first one until all k warehouses are selected. The time complexity of this algorithm is O((k*n)^2) and the space complexity is O(n). This part is designed and written by Serkan Kutludağ and Yarkın Gazi.
