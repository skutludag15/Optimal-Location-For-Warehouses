non_polynomial.py
In this solution we made use of combinations and this way we were able to give the correct output regardless of the question lenght and time. The time complexity of this method is O(n*kcomb(n,k)) but it always give the correct output. The space complexity is in the order of comb(n,k).

We also implemented the capability to read from files and time computation related functions. 

This part is completed by Can Koz and Batuhan Acar.
